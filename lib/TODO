Database
    Change to cloud based database for watchlists?

Portfolio UI
    reorder list on long press?


Portfolio Stuff
    Change Add to be stateless and use BLoC? - currently works, but the callback method seems wrong
    Reorder portfolios - control is there, but the Reorderable doesn't seem to work in a listview parent
    On the add/edit portfolio, we have to use onChanged.  Why?  We only care after they save, but it doesn't change on the onSaved call
